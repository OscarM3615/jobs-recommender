77,2,SENIOR NLP ENGINEER,Remoto,Remoto,Svitla Systems,,You will work closely with the engineering team to ensure the data science and machine learning pipelines are performant in production.,"Svitla Systems Inc. is looking for a Senior NLP Engineer for a full-time position (40 hours per week) in Mexico. Our client is the all-in-one spend management solution for small and mid-market companies. It is an AI-powered spend intelligence solution that saves companies money by analyzing expense drivers and finding line-item level insights often overlooked by finance teams and budget owners. The company is based in New York, United States. It is an AI-powered spend intelligence solution that saves SMBs money by analyzing expense drivers and finding line-item level insights overlooked by most accounts payable solutions, focused on speeding up payment cycles rather than optimizing vendor spend. Over time, the client’s mission is to become the all-in-one spend management solution for SMBs that uses AI to: analyze spend, manage approval and payment workflows, identify anomalous spend and savings opportunities, benchmark spend performance vs. peers, find and negotiate savings with vendors, and forecast future expense trends. The client is building more of the core IP. They are searching for an NLP specialist to join the machine learning team; you will own the NLP models the client builds to extract data from invoices, map line items to their canonical forms, and reconcile the invoice data to the general ledger. Here’s how it works: after they ingest PDFs from clients, they perform OCR, extract the text using text classification models, validate the extraction with a human in the loop, and then map all the data into the canonical taxonomy. Once the data is mapped to the taxonomy, it has a clean digital invoice-based data asset. The client generates insights using this data asset, surfacing line-item level insights via the client's web app.
Requirements:
3+ years of experience with Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP.
Experience building and deploying deep learning models using TensorFlow and/or PyTorch.
Expertise in NLP.
You want to join an early-stage startup, or you are incredibly anxious to be challenged at your first startup.
You like the tension between craft and shipping. You have a strong ability to quickly and effectively evaluate technical tradeoffs and translate them into short/long term business decisions.
You’ve built highly scalable data pipelines and have deep expertise in setting technical vision, architecting, building, and maintaining performant systems, from launch to scale.
You are passionate about building / leading data science teams and rapidly developing data pipelines at various stages of growth.
You pride yourself in communicating complex concepts, including the ability to distill intricate workflows and systems into transparent processes and decisions with measurable company-wide impact.
You ask “why” a lot and use critical thinking and data to back up your intuitions. You hate when a customer struggles through your product experience.
You have managed a budget before and have seen first-hand the challenges in managing vendor spending.
Responsibilities:
Code to clean and prepare the data extracted from invoices, including handling nulls, addressing exceptions, imputing data (when possible), and enriching data using third-party APIs.
Code to validate the goodness of extractions performed by the ML models and humans in the loop.
In-house models to perform OCR and text classification.
In-house NLP models to map the extracted data to the client's canonical taxonomy of vendors and line items (e.g., using word embeddings, etc.) at scale.
In-house NLP models to perform two-way reconciliation between invoice data and the general ledger.
Work closely with the data engineers and data scientists to produce the data science and machine learning code developed. You will work closely with the engineering team to ensure the data science and machine learning pipelines are performant in production.
Data science vision – ownership over and definition of the data science pipeline, working closely with the executive team, and acting as a thought leader across the company.
Technical execution – define, articulate, and execute the data science strategy from launch to scale, manage day-to-day performance, and implement best practices.
Fast prototyping culture – Develop data science and machine learning applications fast, prototyping quickly to solve thorny business problems without getting bogged down in theory (ship early and often).
Getting your hands dirty - there is a small team, and they have a lot of work ahead of us. You should be excited to roll up your sleeves and help the team in any way you can.
Build, build, build – jumping in and writing data science code, from architecture to fixing bugs, delivering NLP models and insights within the first three months of hire. The client relies on you and your team to handle day-to-day execution, including:
Clean the extracted data, validating the accuracy of the extraction, and addressing issues as they occur;
Ship NLP applications to perform mapping of extracted data at scale;
Develop and deploy models using PyTorch or TensorFlow;
Perform feature engineering on the cleansed and mapped data;
Generate insights and narratives;
Wrangle, standardize, enhance, implement, and monitor data repositories;
Create workflows to ingest, enrich, and make data available across the client’s platform.

Job Description
The next great shift in consumer behavior driven by technological disruption is underway, and it’s happening in the food & beverage industry.

As other sectors have shifted to eCommerce-first business models in recent years, food & beverage has continued to rely predominantly on traditional brick & mortar models, but this is changing rapidly. New technologies are transforming every aspect of reaching consumers, from the rise of digital marketing and online grocery platforms, to the creation of supply chain tools that enable speedy at-home delivery. According to the Food Marketing Institute, 70% of U.S. consumers will shop online for groceries by 2024, with an estimated annual spend of $100 billion.

Although PepsiCo is a large multinational, the PepsiCo Global eCommerce Team prides itself on having the entrepreneurial, action-oriented culture of an exciting startup business. Our group includes startup founders, Silicon Valley veterans, food & beverage experts, and seasoned executives from digital transformation leaders such as Amazon and Walmart. Our goal is to build the technological products and capabilities that will reinvent our industry and make us the #1 food & beverage business in eCommerce for decades to come.
