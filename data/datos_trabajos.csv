Preferred Qualifications
The Virtual Operating System (VOS) development group provides a portable and high-performance platform for the Oracle Database. VOS is the platform upon which the database and the database cloud is built.

We define abstractions and develop infrastructure modules that provide process/thread/user-threads management and scheduling, memory management, heap management, synchronization support, CPU/GPU and I/O resource allocation, placement and management, cloud interfacing and management, bin packing, machine learning, intercluster and interprocess communication, high-performance file and storage I/O, event model, statistics, data representation, compression, encryption, persistent memory programming model and more for autonomous cloud, hybrid cloud, cloud, onprem environments.
Team and Product Description:
Oracle is the overall leader in the worldwide relational database management systems (RDBMS) software market. Oracle is the industry's most popular database by more than a two to one margin over its nearest competitor.
Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors. Traditional database clouds are manually managed and tuned, subject to human error, and easily exposed to costly security vulnerabilities, making the promise of cloud savings and efficiency unattainable. Oracle is using machine learning to revolutionize data management with the introduction of the world’s first autonomous database cloud, delivering more automation for more savings.

Achieving high performance on a broad variety of platforms and exploiting new technologies are important to maintaining Oracle's current and future leadership position in the database market.

We ensure that the Oracle database is a market leader on all cloud and platforms, from clustered Linux blade servers to the largest SMP servers (100+ cores and more than 16-32TB of DRAM). We define interfaces to the platform-specific layer that exploit OS-specific functionality, such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, persistent memory, dynamic reconfiguration, user-mode threads, cloud-computing, encryption, compression and virtualization.

Our evaluations of leading technologies such as Infiniband, as high throughput low latency interconnect, TSX, offload-engines, and leading-edge microprocessors like Intel-Cascade Lake, ARM, often lead to hardware enhancements that improve Oracle database performance and scalability.

We often recommend introduction of new interfaces operating system and storage vendors. We continuously collaborate with hardware/OS/storage vendors to understand their roadmaps and to propose improvements for better database performance and functionality.

Description of the Role: Actual job responsibilities/tasks
Responsibilities for a developer in the VOS area include designing and developing database kernel abstractions and modules to introduce new functionality or enhance scalability and performance, interfacing with other database developers to gather requirements for improving the database kernel, collaborating with OS/hardware vendors and the performance group on high-profile benchmarks, and providing systems expertise to the database division.

Through us, one gets an opportunity to interact with the various group in DB division, designers and architects in Cloud, Operating System and Hardware vendors and influence future software and hardware designs and roadmaps.
We seek strong analytical and problem-solving skills, parallel programming, multi-threaded programming, coursework in operating systems and computer architecture (yeah!, the low level stuff), and proficiency in C or C++. If you enjoy solving complex software problems and learning about new technologies, talk to us!

Preferred Qualifications
The Virtual Operating System (VOS) development group provides a portable and high-performance platform for the Oracle Database. VOS is the platform upon which the database and the database cloud is built.

We define abstractions and develop infrastructure modules that provide process/thread/user-threads management and scheduling, memory management, heap management, synchronization support, CPU/GPU and I/O resource allocation, placement and management, cloud interfacing and management, bin packing, machine learning, intercluster and interprocess communication, high-performance file and storage I/O, event model, statistics, data representation, compression, encryption, persistent memory programming model and more for autonomous cloud, hybrid cloud, cloud, onprem environments.
Team and Product Description:
Oracle is the overall leader in the worldwide relational database management systems (RDBMS) software market. Oracle is the industry's most popular database by more than a two to one margin over its nearest competitor.
Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors. Traditional database clouds are manually managed and tuned, subject to human error, and easily exposed to costly security vulnerabilities, making the promise of cloud savings and efficiency unattainable. Oracle is using machine learning to revolutionize data management with the introduction of the world’s first autonomous database cloud, delivering more automation for more savings.

Achieving high performance on a broad variety of platforms and exploiting new technologies are important to maintaining Oracle's current and future leadership position in the database market.

We ensure that the Oracle database is a market leader on all cloud and platforms, from clustered Linux blade servers to the largest SMP servers (100+ cores and more than 16-32TB of DRAM). We define interfaces to the platform-specific layer that exploit OS-specific functionality, such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, persistent memory, dynamic reconfiguration, user-mode threads, cloud-computing, encryption, compression and virtualization.

Our evaluations of leading technologies such as Infiniband, as high throughput low latency interconnect, TSX, offload-engines, and leading-edge microprocessors like Intel-Cascade Lake, ARM, often lead to hardware enhancements that improve Oracle database performance and scalability.

We often recommend introduction of new interfaces operating system and storage vendors. We continuously collaborate with hardware/OS/storage vendors to understand their roadmaps and to propose improvements for better database performance and functionality.

Description of the Role: Actual job responsibilities/tasks
Responsibilities for a developer in the VOS area include designing and developing database kernel abstractions and modules to introduce new functionality or enhance scalability and performance, interfacing with other database developers to gather requirements for improving the database kernel, collaborating with OS/hardware vendors and the performance group on high-profile benchmarks, and providing systems expertise to the database division.

Through us, one gets an opportunity to interact with the various group in DB division, designers and architects in Cloud, Operating System and Hardware vendors and influence future software and hardware designs and roadmaps.
We seek strong analytical and problem-solving skills, parallel programming, multi-threaded programming, coursework in operating systems and computer architecture (yeah!, the low level stuff), and proficiency in C or C++. If you enjoy solving complex software problems and learning about new technologies, talk to us!

Preferred Qualifications
The Virtual Operating System (VOS) development group provides a portable and high-performance platform for the Oracle Database. VOS is the platform upon which the database and the database cloud is built.

We define abstractions and develop infrastructure modules that provide process/thread/user-threads management and scheduling, memory management, heap management, synchronization support, CPU/GPU and I/O resource allocation, placement and management, cloud interfacing and management, bin packing, machine learning, intercluster and interprocess communication, high-performance file and storage I/O, event model, statistics, data representation, compression, encryption, persistent memory programming model and more for autonomous cloud, hybrid cloud, cloud, onprem environments.
Team and Product Description:
Oracle is the overall leader in the worldwide relational database management systems (RDBMS) software market. Oracle is the industry's most popular database by more than a two to one margin over its nearest competitor.
Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors. Traditional database clouds are manually managed and tuned, subject to human error, and easily exposed to costly security vulnerabilities, making the promise of cloud savings and efficiency unattainable. Oracle is using machine learning to revolutionize data management with the introduction of the world’s first autonomous database cloud, delivering more automation for more savings.

Achieving high performance on a broad variety of platforms and exploiting new technologies are important to maintaining Oracle's current and future leadership position in the database market.

We ensure that the Oracle database is a market leader on all cloud and platforms, from clustered Linux blade servers to the largest SMP servers (100+ cores and more than 16-32TB of DRAM). We define interfaces to the platform-specific layer that exploit OS-specific functionality, such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, persistent memory, dynamic reconfiguration, user-mode threads, cloud-computing, encryption, compression and virtualization.

Our evaluations of leading technologies such as Infiniband, as high throughput low latency interconnect, TSX, offload-engines, and leading-edge microprocessors like Intel-Cascade Lake, ARM, often lead to hardware enhancements that improve Oracle database performance and scalability.

We often recommend introduction of new interfaces operating system and storage vendors. We continuously collaborate with hardware/OS/storage vendors to understand their roadmaps and to propose improvements for better database performance and functionality.

Description of the Role: Actual job responsibilities/tasks
Responsibilities for a developer in the VOS area include designing and developing database kernel abstractions and modules to introduce new functionality or enhance scalability and performance, interfacing with other database developers to gather requirements for improving the database kernel, collaborating with OS/hardware vendors and the performance group on high-profile benchmarks, and providing systems expertise to the database division.

Through us, one gets an opportunity to interact with the various group in DB division, designers and architects in Cloud, Operating System and Hardware vendors and influence future software and hardware designs and roadmaps.
We seek strong analytical and problem-solving skills, parallel programming, multi-threaded programming, coursework in operating systems and computer architecture (yeah!, the low level stuff), and proficiency in C or C++.

Preferred Qualifications
The Virtual Operating System (VOS) development group provides a portable and high-performance platform for the Oracle Database. VOS is the platform upon which the database and the database cloud is built.

We define abstractions and develop infrastructure modules that provide process/thread/user-threads management and scheduling, memory management, heap management, synchronization support, CPU/GPU and I/O resource allocation, placement and management, cloud interfacing and management, bin packing, machine learning, intercluster and interprocess communication, high-performance file and storage I/O, event model, statistics, data representation, compression, encryption, persistent memory programming model and more for autonomous cloud, hybrid cloud, cloud, onprem environments.
Team and Product Description:
Oracle is the overall leader in the worldwide relational database management systems (RDBMS) software market. Oracle is the industry's most popular database by more than a two to one margin over its nearest competitor.
Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors. Traditional database clouds are manually managed and tuned, subject to human error, and easily exposed to costly security vulnerabilities, making the promise of cloud savings and efficiency unattainable. Oracle is using machine learning to revolutionize data management with the introduction of the world’s first autonomous database cloud, delivering more automation for more savings.

Achieving high performance on a broad variety of platforms and exploiting new technologies are important to maintaining Oracle's current and future leadership position in the database market.

We ensure that the Oracle database is a market leader on all cloud and platforms, from clustered Linux blade servers to the largest SMP servers (100+ cores and more than 16-32TB of DRAM). We define interfaces to the platform-specific layer that exploit OS-specific functionality, such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, persistent memory, dynamic reconfiguration, user-mode threads, cloud-computing, encryption, compression and virtualization.

Our evaluations of leading technologies such as Infiniband, as high throughput low latency interconnect, TSX, offload-engines, and leading-edge microprocessors like Intel-Cascade Lake, ARM, often lead to hardware enhancements that improve Oracle database performance and scalability.

We often recommend introduction of new interfaces operating system and storage vendors. We continuously collaborate with hardware/OS/storage vendors to understand their roadmaps and to propose improvements for better database performance and functionality.

Description of the Role: Actual job responsibilities/tasks
Responsibilities for a developer in the VOS area include designing and developing database kernel abstractions and modules to introduce new functionality or enhance scalability and performance, interfacing with other database developers to gather requirements for improving the database kernel, collaborating with OS/hardware vendors and the performance group on high-profile benchmarks, and providing systems expertise to the database division.

Through us, one gets an opportunity to interact with the various group in DB division, designers and architects in Cloud, Operating System and Hardware vendors and influence future software and hardware designs and roadmaps.
We seek strong analytical and problem-solving skills, parallel programming, multi-threaded programming, coursework in operating systems and computer architecture (yeah!, the low level stuff), and proficiency in C or C++.

Preferred Qualifications
The Virtual Operating System (VOS) development group provides a portable and high-performance platform for the Oracle Database. VOS is the platform upon which the database and the database cloud is built.

We define abstractions and develop infrastructure modules that provide process/thread/user-threads management and scheduling, memory management, heap management, synchronization support, CPU/GPU and I/O resource allocation, placement and management, cloud interfacing and management, bin packing, machine learning, intercluster and interprocess communication, high-performance file and storage I/O, event model, statistics, data representation, compression, encryption, persistent memory programming model and more for autonomous cloud, hybrid cloud, cloud, onprem environments.
Team and Product Description:
Oracle is the overall leader in the worldwide relational database management systems (RDBMS) software market. Oracle is the industry's most popular database by more than a two to one margin over its nearest competitor.
Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors. Traditional database clouds are manually managed and tuned, subject to human error, and easily exposed to costly security vulnerabilities, making the promise of cloud savings and efficiency unattainable. Oracle is using machine learning to revolutionize data management with the introduction of the world’s first autonomous database cloud, delivering more automation for more savings.

Achieving high performance on a broad variety of platforms and exploiting new technologies are important to maintaining Oracle's current and future leadership position in the database market.

We ensure that the Oracle database is a market leader on all cloud and platforms, from clustered Linux blade servers to the largest SMP servers (100+ cores and more than 16-32TB of DRAM). We define interfaces to the platform-specific layer that exploit OS-specific functionality, such as NUMA-aware memory allocation, persistent memory, dynamic reconfiguration, user-mode threads, cloud-computing, encryption, compression and virtualization.

Our evaluations of leading technologies such as Infiniband, as high throughput low latency interconnect, TSX, offload-engines, and leading-edge microprocessors like Intel-Cascade Lake, ARM, often lead to hardware enhancements that improve Oracle database performance and scalability.

We often recommend introduction of new interfaces operating system and storage vendors. We continuously collaborate with hardware/OS/storage vendors to understand their roadmaps and to propose improvements for better database performance and functionality.

Description of the Role: Actual job responsibilities/tasks
Responsibilities for a developer in the VOS area include designing and developing database kernel abstractions and modules to introduce new functionality or enhance scalability and performance, interfacing with other database developers to gather requirements for improving the database kernel, collaborating with OS/hardware vendors and the performance group on high-profile benchmarks, and providing systems expertise to the database division.

Through us, one gets an opportunity to interact with the various group in DB division, designers and architects in Cloud, Operating System and Hardware vendors and influence future software and hardware designs and roadmaps.
We seek strong analytical and problem-solving skills, parallel programming, multi-threaded programming, coursework in operating systems and computer architecture (yeah!, the low level stuff), and proficiency in C or C++.
